# SoneMC - Minecraft Plugin Development

Welcome to **SoneMC**'s official GitHub! I'm developing Minecraft plugins primarily focused on *Fun*, but there will be plenty of other categories covered too!

## 🚀 About This

**SoneMC** was launched on **February 17, 2025**, after I created the *Valentines* plugin and wanted to share it with the community. Since then, this whole **project** has been growing, and I hope it will continue for months or even years to come.

### 🔧 Projects

Here are some of the current projects under the **SoneMC** umbrella:

- **[Website](https://sonemc.pages.dev)** – The main website where you can find **everything** about **SoneMC's plugins**.
- **[Tool - TextEditor](https://sonemc.pages.dev/tools/texteditor/)** – A handy tool to help you with your server’s MOTD and messages using color codes (`&`).
- **More?** – Absolutely! Keep an eye out for more exciting projects coming soon!

Feel free to explore these projects! They might be just what you need to enhance your server. 😉

## 📢 Community

Even though we're a new project, we already have a **Discord** community where you can ask questions, help others, or simply chat about Minecraft and development.

## 📚 Documentation

Each plugin has its own **detailed documentation**, covering everything from features and permissions to default configurations. These docs should make it easy for you to understand how to use and configure the plugins.

## 💬 Ratings?

As of now, there aren't many ratings, so I’d be really grateful if you could take a minute to test out the plugins and leave a rating! It makes a huge difference and helps me improve.
